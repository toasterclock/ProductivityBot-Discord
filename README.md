# ProductivityBot for Discord


###### Simple discord productivity bot i made for my computing project


## Features!
**New**: Embeds across all functions! Now everything looks twice as pretty!
- Multi-user To-do Lists
- Stopwatch
- A help command
## Upcoming:

- History of your productivity sessions (Unconfirmed)
- An automated timer/stopwatch (based on when a user joins a "work" voice channel) (Unconfirmed)
- Server to-do lists (for those Class Homework Lists or Collaborative work)

## Usage/Setup:

### Ways to make the Todo List work:
- Repl.it Database (what I currently use and think is the easiest)
- Any key-value store
- A text file

### What you need:  
- .env file with this inside (discord bot token):
```TOKEN = your discord bot token```
  - [Guide](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/)
- Ensure discord.py is installed
  - [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

- (OPTIONAL if you want to run it online for free)[Repl.it](replit.com)


###### This is WIP. Do post an issue or reach out to me if you have any ideas or advice on how I can make this bot better/easier to clone and run
