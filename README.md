**New**: Embeds across all functions! Now everything looks twice as pretty!  
**Also New!**: Server to-do lists (for those Class Homework Lists or Collaborative work)  
- Multi-user To-do Lists
- Stopwatch (+ Automatic stopwatch!)
  - simply make a voice channel called ProductivityTimer and join it to start timing
- A help command
## Upcoming:
- History of your productivity sessions (Unconfirmed)
- Points and Leaderboards system to see who did the most work (by stopwatch)

### What you need:
###### Please let me know how I can improve this section
