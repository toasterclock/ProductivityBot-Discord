# ProductivityBot for Discord
###### Basically a better To-do list, and some easter eggs
###### Confirmed working on: Python > 3.7

##### ProductivityBot might go online, but I'm still considering where to host it.
##### New features are underway, and not all of them will be open-sourced (sorry!)



## Features!
**New**: Embeds across all functions! Now everything looks twice as pretty!  
**Also New!**: Server to-do lists (for those Class Homework Lists or Collaborative work)  
- Multi-user To-do Lists
- Study Timer + Points system!
  - Tracks how long you study based on how long you are in the Study Call
## Upcoming:
- History of your productivity sessions (Unconfirmed)
- Points and Leaderboards system to see who did the most work (by stopwatch)

## Usage/Setup:

### Currently, databases are stored within the .sqlite file that will be auto-created

### What you need:
###### Please let me know how I can improve this section
- .env file with this inside (discord bot token):
```TOKEN=your discord bot token```
  - [Guide](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/)
- install required packages with ```pip install -r requirements.txt```

###### This is WIP. Do post an issue or reach out to me if you have any ideas or advice on how I can make this bot better/easier to clone and run
